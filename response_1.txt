- Hey, I'm Vineet from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, a proud IIT Kanpur alumnus with a specialization in Mechanical Engineering.
- Currently rocking the tech world as a Software Developer with over 1.5 years at a fast-paced YC-backed startup, earning the title of "Employer of the Quarter" and the highest appraisal.
- Master of automations, including one that had half the sales team bidding farewell, and expertise in working with LLMs, AWS, Docker, and Jenkins.
- I've contributed to web development through internships and projects while solving over 4000 DSA problems and earning the title of an Expert on Codeforces with a 1700 rating.
- Outside of work, I'm either grooving to tunes or engaging in random fun with people. I have a fondness for rain, cats, Taylor, Harry, and LDR (Lana Del Rey), in no particular order.
