Over the past 1.5 years at Anakin, a YC-backed startup, I've delved into the dynamic world of AI and cloud infrastructure. My journey has taken me through the landscape of AWS, where I drastically cut infrastructure costs by 65% with strategic optimizations. My role involved not only creating robust pipelines with Jenkins and Docker but also innovating with LLMs to automate personalized messaging systems. My problem-solving skills were honed through competitive programming, and I've leveraged them extensively to enhance efficiency and resilience in cloud environments. From web development internships, I've gained a holistic view of software engineering, driving impactful automation and troubleshooting solutions in high-pressure settings.
