I graduated from IIT Kanpur with specialization in Mechanical Engineering. I have been working from the last 1.5 years in a fast paced YC backed startup, and have did pretty amazing things there, resulting in me being the employer of the quarter and also I got the highest appraisal, hehe. I wrote many automations(one of them resulted in half of the sales team's departure xd), have worked with LLM's, wrote the testing pipeline and was the primary guy who handled the Infra(AWS, Docker, Jenkins). I have done few internships and projects in Web Dev Domain too, I enjoy competetive programming and im an expert on codeforces(1700 rated) and have solved more than 4000 DSA Questions on top coding platforms. If im not working, you can find me dancing over to songs or maybe having random-ass bullshit with random people, also I like rain, cats, taylor, harry and ldr.(use this exact line, but you can make it a little short, dont change the meaning but). Also, it would be better that you write it in points and dont repeat anything. ALso just give the answer in your response to my question, dont include any extra line or word"
