<Here is my info details>

Intro:

Hey,
I‚Äôm Vineet, an IIT Kanpur alumnus, and I came across your company on LinkedIn. I‚Äôm excited about the possibility of joining your team as a software developer. With about 1.5 years of experience as an SDE, plus two internships under my belt, I believe I‚Äôd be a great fit.

A few fun facts about me:

1. I enjoy competitive programming and boast a rating of around 1800 on Codeforces.
2. I once reduced AWS infrastructure costs at Anakin by 65%‚Äîand yes, I might be responsible for half the sales team's departure!
3. I can scale, store and solve efficiently.


My work at anakin in detail:
Scrapers - 1 week completed zepto onboarding, next week i started with my first scraper, and it was a bidding one, somehow I ran it for around 2 months, but now account genertion in it is pending after several tries done by me, paritosh and shamil. Then after i completed another rival uklon and it is running continuously from then without any errors. Completed it 100%

Generic Scraper - I wrote the generic scraper documentation and several xpaths of the top 50 websites to make it more efficient. Also i almost added the authentication part using auth0 for generic scraper, i completed it around 80%, but wasnt able to complete it as it was launched on monday, and some work was remaining before that, so dev completed it on the weeknd. As i was here a helping hand, i didnt completed it truly by myself.

Tech Cost Calculation - Added tags on various AWS Resources like Volumes, EC2 Instances, ECS Tasks etc, and then wrote the code to handle 100Gb's of cost report snd S3 files and successfully found the total Client-wise AWS cost, here everything i did solely myself without any tech supervision. Completed this 100%.

AWS Cost Optimization - The bill was around 48k(if we include the new ipv4 address cost that was added later), i helped in reduced it by 65+%. I made a spot cluster and moved by own rival to spot alone and tested it thoroughly, i moved gp3 volumes to gp2. I moved the data to glacier from S3. Still working on it. 

AWS and Jenkins - Worked on numerous AWS and Jenkins bugs and created a new testing pipeline to facilitate the building of scrapers through their own branches. Wrote a lambda to re run tasks in case of some errors. Wrote a lambda which terminate 12 hour old instances and stop 12 hour old tasks too. Added many features in pipeline like scheduling tasks in different clusters in the same build and according to the timezone provided in config. Succesfully fixed hundreds of bugs 100%.

Sales Messages - I scraped the 100% data from YC page and found out the list of founders and their respective company from there. Then I scraped their funding from crunchbase and filtered them. I scraped their whole linkedin profiled and even their posts. I scraped the latest google news about those startups and their founders. After getting all these infomation I wrote such a prompt using GPT which will write a human like message, with very minute great details in it. The sales person used to write 40 messages in day at max, with my script there is no end! I did all of this without any tech supervision, and completed it 100%.
